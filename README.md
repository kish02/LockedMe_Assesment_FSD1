Usage
During the whole usage of the program, you don't have to specify the file extension .txt as it gets added to every query automatically as this program is designed to work only with files with .txt file extension for convenience.

LockedMeMain.java has 3 options:

Show all files.
Shows all the files (will not show folders, only files) in the .FilesFolder/ directory. Will prompt if no files exist in the directory along with the relative path of the directory. (.FilesFolder/ directory gets autogenerated when running the program along with files from File 1 to File 10)

Display menu for operations. (Expert Mode)
Shows further options to operate on files as shown below.

Exit Program.
Exits from the program.

On selecting option 2 (Expert Mode), you will see further options:

Search a file.

<- fileName

Prompts whether a fileName.txt exists or not along with relative file path.

Add a file.

-> Enter the name of the file to add below.

<- fileName

Prompts whether the fileName.txt file got successfully created or not.

Write to a file.

-> Enter the name of the file to write below.

Prompts whether the write operation was successful or not. If the fileName does not exist, fileName.txt will get created automatically.
